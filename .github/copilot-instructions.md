- **New Game Action:** Update Redux slice, socket events, and server-side game logic with type-safe parameters
- **Database Changes:** Update MongoDB queries and shared TypeScript interfaces with proper type validation
- **New Shared Type:** Add to `src/shared/interfaces/` or `src/shared/enums/` for consistency and type safety

## Sandbox Mode Development Patterns
- **Action Validation:** Use `validateForSandbox()` wrapper from `src/server/utils/sandboxValidator.util.ts`
- **Phase Control:** Check `games[roomId].sandboxMode` before auto-progressing phases
- **UI Components:** Add conditional sandbox indicators using `gameState.game.sandboxMode`
- **Sequence Resolution:** Auto-resolve player input requirements in sandbox mode
- **State Interfaces:** Include `sandboxMode: boolean` in both client/server GameState interfaces
- **Game Log Display:** Use conditional rendering for game log vs sequence state in Toolbar component
- **Zone Index Tracking:** Include `zoneIndex` parameter in drag-and-drop event data for accurate card positioning

## Enhanced Filtering Development Patterns
- **MultiSelect Usage:** Import from `src/client/ui/multiselect.tsx` for consistent multi-selection UI
- **API Filtering:** Use `fetchCards({legion, query, page, pageSize, type, rarity, set})` pattern
- **Filter State Management:** Maintain separate state arrays for each filter type (legion, type, rarity, set)
- **Responsive Filters:** Use conditional rendering `hidden sm:block` for mobile optimization
- **Backend Integration:** Extend routes with filter parameter validation and MongoDB query building
- **Filter Options:** Use `fetchFilterOptions()` to populate available filter values dynamically

## Client Settings Architecture
- **Settings Store:** `clientSettingsSlice.ts` manages UI preferences with Redux Toolkit
- **Persistent Storage:** `useClientSettings()` hook provides localStorage integration
- **Available Settings:** `hoverMenu` (boolean), `legacyMenu` (boolean) for UI behavior control
- **Real-time Updates:** Settings changes immediately affect UI without page refresh
- **Hook Pattern:** Custom hook manages both state access and localStorage persistence
- **Default Values:** settings default to `true` for both hover and legacy menu options

## Image Preloading Development Patterns
- **Preloader Import:** Import `imagePreloader` singleton from `src/client/utils/imagePreloader.ts`
- **Utility Functions:** Use `preloadDeckImages()`, `preloadGameImages()`, `preloadSearchResults()` for common scenarios
- **Priority Levels:** Set appropriate priority ('high', 'normal', 'low') based on user interaction context
- **Connection Awareness:** System automatically adapts to user's network conditions and data saver preferences
- **Memory Management:** Built-in cache size limits and cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Background Loading:** Use `preloadAllCardsBackground()` for non-critical preloading with delays
- **Performance Monitoring:** Use `imagePreloader.getStats()` for debugging and optimization
- **Service Worker Integration:** Automatic background caching when Service Worker is available

## Client Settings Development Patterns
- **Settings Import:** Import from `src/client/redux/clientSettingsSlice.ts` for UI preference management
- **Settings Hook:** Use `useClientSettings()` hook from `src/client/hooks/useClientSettings.ts` for full settings management
- **State Access:** Use `useAppSelector((state) => state.clientSettings)` to access current settings
- **Settings Updates:** Dispatch `setHoverMenu()`, `setLegacyMenu()` actions or use hook methods for real-time UI changes
- **Persistent Settings:** Automatic localStorage persistence via useClientSettings hook
- **Available Settings:** `hoverMenu` (boolean) and `legacyMenu` (boolean) for UI behavior control
- **Component Integration:** Add settings controls in toolbar or settings modals with immediate effect

## Authentication & User Management
- **Frontend Auth:** Use `useAuth` hook from `src/client/hooks/useAuth.ts` for session state
- **Protected Routes:** Add authentication checks to modals and forms before API calls
- **Server Middleware:** Use `requireAuth` or `optionalAuth` from `src/server/middleware/auth.ts`
- **Data Isolation:** Filter database queries by `userId` for user-specific data
- **Session Management:** NextAuth.js handles OAuth flow, JWT tokens, and session persistence

## TypeScript Architecture & Best Practices
- **Zero Compilation Errors:** Project maintains strict TypeScript compliance with comprehensive type safety
- **Foundational Type System:** Custom interfaces for Socket.IO, Express middleware, and game state management
- **Shared Type Architecture:** Consolidated interfaces in `src/shared/` prevent client-server type drift
- **Type-Safe Networking:** Socket events and Express routes use proper parameter typing with custom extensions

### Key Type Interfaces
```typescript
// Socket.IO Extensions
interface IOServer extends Server { }
interface CustomSocket extends Socket { room?: string; }

// Express Extensions
interface ExpressApp extends Express { }
interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request { userId?: string; user?: object; }

// Game State with Safe Property Access
interface GameStateData {
  // ... game properties
  [key: string]: unknown; // Safe index signature for CARD_TARGET access
}
```

### Type Safety Patterns
- **Index Signatures:** Use `(games[roomId][target] as CardInterface[])` for safe property access on game state
- **Error Handling:** Catch clauses use `unknown` type with proper type guards instead of `any`
- **API Callbacks:** Define specific callback interfaces: `(data: unknown) => void` with proper casting
- **Socket Events:** Type-safe event payloads with custom Socket.IO interfaces
- **Card Type Flexibility:** Union types `id: string | number` support both MongoDB ObjectId and numeric formats
- **Build Validation:** `npm run build` ensures zero TypeScript compilation errors before deployment

### Critical Type Files
- `src/server/interfaces/SocketTypes.ts` - Socket.IO server and event payload types
- `src/server/interfaces/ExpressTypes.ts` - Express app and authenticated request extensions
- `src/shared/interfaces/RoomInterface.ts` - Room and player management types
- `src/server/interfaces/GameState.ts` - Server-side game state with index signature
- `src/client/interfaces/GameState.ts` - Client-side game state interface
- `src/client/interfaces/Card.mongo.ts` - MongoDB card document interface

### TypeScript Development Rules
- **Never use `any`:** Always prefer `unknown` with type guards or specific interfaces
- **Type Assertions:** Use `as Type` casting for safe property access on indexed game state
- **Import Consistency:** Import from `@/shared/` for common types, maintain client/server separation
- **Error Safety:** Use `error: unknown` in catch blocks with proper type checking
- **Build Testing:** Run `npm run build` after type changes to ensure zero compilation errors

## Modern Development Patterns
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Project uses strict TypeScript configuration for better type safety
- **Optional Chaining:** Use `?.()` syntax for safe function calls and property access
- **Nullish Coalescing:** Use `??` operator for precise fallback handling (preserves falsy but defined values)
- **React Suspense:** Implement Suspense boundaries for loading states and code splitting
- **Error Boundaries:** (Recommended) Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
- **Custom Hooks:** Consistent patterns with useAuth, useSocket, useClickOutside, useEffectAsync

## Environment & Configuration
- **Production API:** `https://lrawbook-service.onrender.com`
- **Development API:** `http://localhost:3000` (configurable port)
- **MongoDB:** Atlas cluster with connection string in server environment
- **External Images:** Configured in `next.config.ts` for legionstoolbox.com

## Deployment Architecture
- **Single Process:** Next.js and Express run together via hybrid setup
- **Docker:** Containerized deployment with `Dockerfile`
- **Health Monitoring:** Cron job for keep-alive pings in production
- **Static Assets:** Next.js handles frontend, Express handles API and Socket.IO
